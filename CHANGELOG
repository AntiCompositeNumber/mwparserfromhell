v0.3 (unreleased):

- Added complete support for HTML Tags, along with appropriate unit tests. This
  includes forms like <ref>foo</ref>, <ref name="bar"/>, and wiki-markup tags
  like bold ('''), italics (''), and lists (''*'', ''#'', '';'' and '':'').
- Various fixes and cleanup.

v0.2 (released June 20, 2013):

- The parser now fully supports Python 3 in addition to Python 2.7.

  equivalent. It is enabled by default (if available) and can be toggled by
  setting `mwparserfromhell.parser.use_c` to a boolean value.
- Added a complete set of unit tests covering parsing and wikicode
  manipulation.
- Renamed Wikicode.filter_links() to filter_wikilinks() (applies to ifilter as
  well).
- Added filter methods for Arguments, Comments, Headings, and HTMLEntities.
- Added 'before' param to Template.add(); renamed 'force_nonconformity' to
  'preserve_spacing'.
- Added 'include_lead' param to Wikicode.get_sections().
- Removed 'flat' param from Wikicode.get_sections().
- Removed 'force_no_field' param from Template.remove().
- Added support for Travis CI.
- Added note about Windows build issue in the README.
- The tokenizer will limit itself to a realistic recursion depth to prevent
  errors and unreasonably long parse times.
- Fixed how some nodes' attribute setters handle input.
- Fixed multiple bugs in the tokenizer's handling of invalid markup.
- Fixed bugs in the implementation of SmartList and StringMixIn.
- Fixed some broken example code in the README; other copyedits.
